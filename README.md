Website traffic analysis is the process of examining user interactions with a website to understand visitor behavior, improve engagement, and optimize performance. It involves collecting and analyzing data such as page views, unique visitors, session duration, bounce rates, and traffic sources.

Key aspects of website traffic analysis include:

User Behavior Tracking: Identifying popular pages, average visit duration, and navigation patterns.

Traffic Sources: Determining whether visitors come from organic search, social media, direct links, or paid advertisements.

Peak Traffic Analysis: Recognizing high-traffic periods to optimize server performance and marketing campaigns.

Bounce Rate & Engagement: Evaluating how long users stay on the site and identifying reasons for early exits.

By leveraging data visualization and analytical tools like Google Analytics, Pandas, and Matplotlib, businesses can make data-driven decisions to enhance user experience and boost online presence.
